To the best of my knowledge everything is working. The only exception to this is when a client submits a request for placement of a token and then continues to type after has hit 'enter' and hits 'enter' again. it's like the data is transmitted or stuck in a buffer as game behaviour becomes inconsistent after this.
Given more time I would research that bug more and if there is anything to do to fix it.

I tested my code by sparking up multiple clients and running multiple games concurrently. I would play as both players but trying to win under the different circumstances like horizontal win, diag win, vertical win. 
The client and server both close there connections after the game is over.

The most challenging part of this project was probably the logic for winning a game. There are many scenarios for winning and there was a lot of edge cases to consider. Luckily for loops exist which means I didn't have to hand code every single check :)

Chess would be pretty awesome however the logic would be much more involved as you have to consider the fact that game pieces can only move in a certain direction. I would hope at that point I would consider a 2D array as this might help with the logic and make it slightly less bad.
